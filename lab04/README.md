I plan to shape an import csv button on the students table to allow our client to add all students from a csv with a predefined template. To ensure the project can be successfully added in the timeframe, a template will be assumed from the csv. csv files not formatted properly will not be read correctly.

The expected flow has been added below

Basic visuals for the implementation have also been added below

The expected csv template and how it maps to the existing project table has also been added below
