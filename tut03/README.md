**Podcast Summary**

The shape up methodology is centered around pitches. Pitches are a potential feature or change to be implemented in sufficient detail that it can be implemented, but not so detailed that it constrains the design unnecessarily. The team responsible for implementing the pitch is also responsible for filling in the implementation as best fit, because improved methods reveal themselves during implementation. By leaving it at the correct amount of detail, the pitch is malleable, which ensures that it can be completed in a pre-allocated cycle.  

Pitches are composed of 5 parts:
- problem
This is the problem statement that is attempted to be solved with the pitch.
- solution
This is how the pitch attempts to resolve the problem introduced
- appetite
This is the employee's motivation to complete the work. By allowing employees to be empowered and partake in meaningful work while implementing the pitch via the designing of the details of the pitch, employees will be further invested into their work.
- rabbit holes
This is where the pitch specifies what won't be solved by the pitch. By limiting the scope, it prevents employees from wasting their time on a less important feature than another

Anyone can offer an idea for a pitch, although successful pitches are mostly created by a mix of designers and those who are more technically savvy. Clients are very good at highlighting problems, but not good at proposing solutions because they are unaware of how the system operates technically and why it was designed how it was.
