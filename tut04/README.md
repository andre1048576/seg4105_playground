Backlogs should not be formed as they demotivate and distract from the important issues that should be designed and developed. Instead, a bet can be re-proposed at the next betting cycle. If it never gets bet on again, then that means either a better solution was bet on or solving the problem wasn't important enough.

Cycles should be long enough to allow a meaningful unit of work to be completed. They should not be so long as to be a meaningful drain on resources should the bet fail. This also means ensuring that no more than one cycle is allocated to a bet, as to minimize risks. Once a bet has been decided, it should be stuck to. This means not deviating to solve miscelaneous issues or bugs that occur. Cooldowns should be implemented as well to allow a concentrated betting phase to occur without the strain of a cycle and to give autonomy and rest to developers after accomplishing a bet.

Betting is different based on the knowledge of the problem area. In a known problem area, such as existing software, standard shape-up is sufficient. However, in areas covered with unknowns, it's important to first research the problem and do draft work on any solutions with the employees with more authorial power. After the research, the production can resume the standard shape-up procedure.

It's important to ensure that the bet is meaningful by reiterating that the problem is important, that the team wants to work on it, that the solution accurately solves the problem, and that the correct people are available and willing to work on the solution.
