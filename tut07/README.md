Daily Scrum Summary.

    The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work. The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint. If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers. The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work. This creates focus and improves self-management.
Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings. The Daily Scrum is not the only time developers are allowed to adjust their plan. They often meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprintâ€™s work. 

Chapter 13 summary.

    It's sometimes impossible to quantify how much of the work has been completed. Additional tasks can be discovered partway through. As a result, it helps to think of tasks like a hill. Part of the task is focused on the discovery of the requirements and the other part as fulfilling the requirements. Hills can also help identify tasks that are stuck. If a task is not progressing, that means that there is a blockade or a lack of information pertaining to the task. It is important to also ensure that tasks are completed according to their complexity and that unknown scopes cannot delay the schedule.
