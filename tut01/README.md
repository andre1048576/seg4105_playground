# What are project managers?

Project Managers are responsible for various tasks, including:
- Managing and allocating employees to different goals
Product Managers manage a team of developers, designers and other specialists to ensure that all of the work obligations are met as efficiently as possible. To this end PMs need to know about the technology stack, the code implementation, who has already worked on which parts to better allocate the employees, and for organizing the team if anything goes awry.

- Managing the production of a product
Product Managers, true to their title, manage the development and conception of a product. They interact with every person related to the product as a result, including employees both above and below them, stakeholders, and clients as needed. They also interact with many aspects of the product itself, such as its implementation and its design.

- Interacting with the stakeholders
Stakeholders are the source for the majority of the requirements for a product, and the Product Manager is responsible for determining what the requirements are for a product and how important they are to the stakeholders. This often also requires determining the value a product provides and how to maximize the value generated proportionally to the cost in both time and money.

- Promoting the product
As a product requires investments and returns to continue development, the Product Manager is tasked with promoting the product where applicable. This includes creating shaped pitches for stakeholders and employees, discussing with the team to refine and hone in on the value the product will provide and describing in simple terms the utility of the product.
