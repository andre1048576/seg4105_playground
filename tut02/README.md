**SEG4105 TUTORIAL 2 - Andre Lacroix**

**Chapter 2:**

It is important to specify the correct amount of detail in a prototype. If you add too few details, it cannot be concretely materialized and doesn't properly serve as a starting point for a design. Too many details, on the other hand, will cause the extraneous details to be considered essential and pigeon holes designers into ideas that aren't optimal.

Shaping is best done by those technically capable, as they are most aware of the capabilities of the tools and can best estimate the needed time to achieve tasks. Shaping also cannot be put on a strict time table unlike building software, as it is impossible to quantify how close a shape-up is to ideal.

**Chapter 3:**

Shape-ups should serve to solve a problem first and foremost. It is imperative to identify the problem that needs to be solved in its purest form. Solving the problem is about achieving as much as sustainably and reasonably possible in a fixed time to address the problem. 

**Chapter 4:**

It is important to not become too invested in a shape up, as it is not concrete yet. To this end, working alone or with another person with awareness of the shape-up is ideal as not many people will be involved at once. Information added at this stage should be capable of generating a minimum viable product. Ensuring that details remain undefined allows for quick discussions on various proposals without getting bogged down by the details.

**Chapter 5:**

While generating a shape up, it is important to confirm with the more technically minded that the shape up is realistically implementable within the period of time before proposing it. It is also important to determine what problems will not be solved by the shape up, as a design that is too large will be unimplementable within a deadline, and there are always new problems that arise in a shape up.
