# Notes on each pitch
- Andre Lacroix:
    - Problem: it is an essential functionality to import students in the website.
    - Appetite: feasible witin the timeframe and the team of 3.
    - Solution: importing students from a CSV is probably the most attractive solution. The only issue might be that the template will not match the outputted information from both Brightspace and uOzone. Thus, the professor/administrator will need to select one source.
    - Timing: already added.
    - Right people: yup we all can add it.
- Laith Grira:
    - Problem: students already have ways to chat to each other
    - Appetite: feasible witin the timeframe and the team of 3.
    - Solution: the solution is well thought out and the positioning within the "My Group" section is logical.
    - Timing: the timing is correct as we are in the process of finishing up the app and testing it.
    - Right people: yup we all can add it.
- Caroline Tippins:
    - Problem: it is an essential functionality to view the application in both French and English as this is required by uOttawa.
    - Appetite: feasible witin the timeframe and the team of 3.
    - Solution: drop down has more buttons vs one-button solution's lack of flexibility. I personally prefer the drop down though.
    - Timing: already half-way implemented.
    - Right people: yup we all can add it.

## Notes from the betting table
- Andre's pitch is disqualified since it's already implemented.
- Laith's pitch is interesting but the work required might require more than 6 weeks and also it might not be as urgent to implement than translating the website from English to French.
- Caroline's pitch is the most appealing as it is necessary for a uOttawa app to be offered in French and English. It is also very feasible to implement within the short timeframe given.

## Updates to pitch
Only put the button feature as the selection of the language since it is easier and more intuitive.
