# Notes on each pitch
- Andre Lacroix:
    - Problem: it is an essential functionality to import students in the website.
    - Appetite: feasible witin the timeframe and the team of 3.
    - Solution: importing students from a CSV is probably the most attractive solution. The only issue might be that the template will not match the outputted information from both Brightspace and uOzone. Thus, the professor/administrator will need to select one source.
    - Timing: it might be a little bit too late since it was already implemented.
    - Right people: yes, we are all capable of implementing this feature.
- Laith Grira:
    - Problem: it might not be essential for students to email each other since they already have ways to do so (e.g., Discord, MSTeams, Outlook, etc.)
    - Appetite: feasible witin the timeframe and the team of 3.
    - Solution: the solution is well thought out and the positioning within the "My Group" section is logical.
    - Timing: the timing is correct as we are in the process of finishing up the app and testing it.
    - Right people: yes, we are all capable of implementing this feature.
- Caroline Tippins:
    - Problem: it is an essential functionality to view the application in both French and English as this is required by uOttawa.
    - Appetite: feasible witin the timeframe and the team of 3.
    - Solution: the solution is attractive and simple. However, there are some trade-offs to selecting a button versus a dropdown to select the language. If a dropdown is selected, then more languages can be added in the future. But a dropdown is less intuitive and provides more steps for the user. A button on the other hand allows users to quickly select the language they want.
    - Timing: it might be a little bit too late since it was already implemented.
    - Right people: yes, we are all capable of implementing this feature.

## Notes from the betting table
- Andre's pitch is disqualified since it's already implemented.
- Laith's pitch is interesting but the work required might require more than 6 weeks and also it might not be as urgent to implement than translating the website from English to French.
- Caroline's pitch is the most appealing as it is necessary for a uOttawa app to be offered in French and English. It is also very feasible to implement within the short timeframe given.

## Updates to pitch
Only put the button feature as the selection of the language since it is easier and more intuitive.
